   This does have some implications on the business going forward:
   1. The firm should focus more on the electronics category and orient marketing and sales strategies to further this category. This may include targeted marketing,expanded product offerings as well as enhancing the overall customer experience.
   2. The clothing category is a high volume low margin business. It would be prudent to continue to drive sales albeit with more renewed focus on the electronics category. Focus should be on optimizing inventory efficiency, operations costs, increasing the average transaction value etc.
   3. The furniture category should be assessed further in terms of business viability. It performs low in quantities sold as well as margins. A reevaluation may be necessary in terms of costs and product offerings */
